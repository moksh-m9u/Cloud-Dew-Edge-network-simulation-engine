"""Latency and deadline model (F5): how long a task would take on a node, and whether that is in time.

The model, from docs/SPEC.md §3::

    processing_ms = work_units / speed_factor
    congestion    = 1 / (1 - min(cpu_load_after_placement, congestion_cap))
    latency_ms    = base_latency_ms + processing_ms * congestion

Load is the CPU used by running tasks (not what VMs have reserved), so an idle
VM doesn't slow a node down. The congestion factor is a simple queueing
(M/M/1-style) approximation: 1 on an idle node, 2 at half load, 10 at 90% load.
Busy nodes therefore get slow fast, like a queue at a counter. ``congestion_cap`` (default 0.95) stops it reaching
infinity on a completely full node.
