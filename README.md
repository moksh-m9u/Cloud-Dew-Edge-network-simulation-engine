  <em>The same 12 tasks through all four placement policies. The smart policies reject what they can't finish in time instead of running it late.</em>
</p>

> **Status:** complete for submission: simulator, both interfaces, the four experiments, report, slides and submission ZIP. See [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md) for the full spec and acceptance criteria.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

There are two ways to use the simulator. Both call the same code, so the same settings and seed give the same results.

**Command-line menu**

```bash
python -m edgefogsim
```

**Streamlit app in your browser**

```bash
python -m edgefogsim web
```

It opens at http://localhost:8501 (change it with `--port 8600`). Stop it with Ctrl+C. It starts on a **Home** page that explains the simulator (tiers, the latency and score formulas with every term, policies, VMs, security, experiments), with a step-by-step guide, a quick-start button that loads the sample tasks and compares all policies, and next-step buttons at the bottom of every page.

### Screenshots

| Command-line menu | Streamlit app |
|---|---|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/cli-menu.png" alt="Command-line menu showing the node table and the numbered menu sections" width="440"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/web-workload.png" alt="Streamlit Workload page with 50 generated tasks, showing only hospital-a's 24" width="440"> |
| Node table with reserved and load figures, and the menu grouped into sections. | Workload page: 50 generated tasks; a tenant sees only their own. |
| <img src="docs/screenshots/cli-placement.png" alt="Command-line placement decisions for Latency-First with a reason for every task" width="440"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/web-placement.png" alt="Streamlit Placement page with metrics, decisions table and nodes after the run" width="440"> |
| Placement decisions: node, VM, latency against deadline, and why. | Placement page: headline metrics, decisions and node usage after the run. |

In either one, log in as a tenant, then:

1. view nodes,
2. build a workload (generate, upload a file or add tasks by hand),
3. run a placement policy and read why each task went where it did,
4. compare all policies on the same workload,
5. view, create and stop VMs (tenant-owned slices of a node that several of that tenant's tasks share), and place a single task on the room that frees up,
6. look up a task or VM by id: another tenant's is refused (ACCESS DENIED) and written to the audit log,
7. export results (CSV, JSON and PNG charts), and as admin change a node and compare before/after,
8. view, change or save settings.

Tenants see only their own tasks, decisions and VMs; `admin` sees everything. Refused attempts are logged to `results/audit.log` (CSV).

**Without the menu** (prints the decisions or the comparison and exits):

```bash
python -m edgefogsim run --policy capacity --tasks examples/tasks_sample.csv
python -m edgefogsim run --policy all --tasks 20 --seed 42
```

Policies: `latency` (Latency-First), `cloud` (Cloud-Only), `capacity` (Capacity-Aware, the main rule-based algorithm) and `topsis` (TOPSIS ranking). Their rules are in [docs/SPEC.md §3](docs/SPEC.md).

Useful options (they work with `menu`, `web` and `run`):

| Option | Example | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `--tasks N` | `--tasks 20` | number of random tasks |
| `--tasks FILE` | `--tasks examples/tasks_sample.csv` | start with your own task list |
| `--seed N` | `--seed 7` | random seed for generated tasks |
| `--nodes FILE` | `--nodes my_nodes.json` | use your own nodes |
| `--config FILE` | `--config my_settings.json` | override any settings |
| `--deadline LEVEL=MS` | `--deadline high=40` | change a deadline |
| `--headroom X` | `--headroom 0.9` | Capacity-Aware utilisation limit |
| `--set KEY=VALUE` | `--set generator.cpu_range=[1,4]` | change any setting |

`python -m edgefogsim menu --help` lists them all.

## Results and charts

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/web-results.png" alt="Streamlit Results page: policy comparison table, task outcomes and placement-by-tier charts, and latency as a share of each task's deadline" width="760">
  <br>
  <em>The app's Results page: the comparison table, where each policy placed the tasks, and latency against each task's deadline.</em>
</p>

Menu option 14 (or the app's **Results** page) saves the last run and the last policy comparison to a new folder under `results/`:

| File | What it holds |
|------|---------------|
| `decisions.csv` | One row per task: node, VM, latency, deadline, outcome, reason |
| `summary.json` | Totals, success rate, average and p95 latency, CPU reserved and load per node |
| `vms.csv`, `nodes.csv` | Every VM and node at the end of the run |
| `comparison.csv` / `.json` | One row per policy |
| `before_after.csv` | Each metric before and after a node change |
| `*.png` | Charts: task outcomes, placement by tier, latency vs deadline, node CPU, before/after |
| `settings_used.json` | The exact settings, reusable with `--config` to repeat the run |

As admin, menu option 15 (or the Results page) changes one node field, for example `edge-1 cpu_cores 8` or `cloud-1 base_latency_ms 150`, runs the same workload again and shows what changed. You can then keep the change for the rest of the session. A tenant's export contains only their own decisions and VMs.

## Experiments

The four experiments the brief requires run with one command:

```bash
python run_experiments.py
```

| Experiment | What it shows |
|------------|---------------|
| E1 Policy comparison | The same 20 tasks through all four policies: the smart policies run nothing late and get more tasks on time |
| E2 Overload | Edge already 90% busy, then 10 urgent tasks: Capacity-Aware moves tasks to Fog or rejects them with a reason; Latency-First runs 9 of 10 late |
| E3 Unauthorised access | hospital-b tries to read and stop hospital-a's task and VM: all 3 attempts are refused and logged; the admin can read them |
| E4 Node change | (a) Edge CPU 4 → 8: more tasks on Edge and on time. (b) Cloud latency 80 → 150 ms: Cloud tasks slow down, medium tasks can't use it any more, low tasks still finish on time |

Each experiment states its expected outcome, runs, then checks the expectation against the actual numbers. The output folder `results/<time>-experiments/` holds `experiments.md` (setup, expected outcome, actual outcome with tables and charts, checks, evidence links) and one evidence folder per experiment. Change the workloads or node changes in `config/experiments.json`, or pass your own file with `--experiments my_experiments.json`. The admin can also run them from menu option 16 or the app's Results page.

## Report, slides and submission

| Deliverable | Where |
|-------------|-------|
| Architecture diagram | [docs/architecture.png](docs/architecture.png) |
| Report (6 pages) | [docs/report/EdgeFogSim_Report.docx](docs/report/EdgeFogSim_Report.docx) ([PDF](docs/report/EdgeFogSim_Report.pdf)) |
| Presentation (7 slides with speaker notes; slide 3 explains every formula term with a worked example) | [docs/report/EdgeFogSim_Slides.pptx](docs/report/EdgeFogSim_Slides.pptx) ([PDF](docs/report/EdgeFogSim_Slides.pdf)) |
| Experiments write-up and evidence | [docs/evidence/experiments/experiments.md](docs/evidence/experiments/experiments.md) |
| Test results | [docs/evidence/test_results.txt](docs/evidence/test_results.txt) |

The diagram, report and slides are generated from the code and a fresh experiment run, so their numbers always match. To regenerate everything, run the tests and build the single submission ZIP:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt   # python-docx and python-pptx, only needed for this step
python make_zip.py --rebuild
```

`make_zip.py` refuses to build if any deliverable the brief lists is missing, and prints the checklist. If LibreOffice is installed (`brew install --cask libreoffice`), it also saves PDF copies of the report and slides. Without `--rebuild` it packs what is already there. Polish the report and slides in Word/PowerPoint afterwards if you like, but note that `--rebuild` overwrites them.

## Test

```bash
pytest
```

## Project layout

| Path | What it holds |
|------|---------------|
| `edgefogsim/` | Simulator source code |
| `config/` | Default settings you can edit: nodes, tenants, simulation, experiments |
| `examples/tasks_sample.csv` | Template for supplying your own task list |
| `tests/` | pytest suite |
| `run_experiments.py` | Runs the four experiments |
| `make_zip.py` | Builds and checks the submission ZIP |
| `tools/` | Scripts that generate the diagram, report and slides |
| `docs/SPEC.md` | Feature spec, acceptance criteria and delivery phases |
| `docs/architecture.png` | Architecture diagram |
| `docs/report/` | Project report (.docx) and presentation (.pptx) |
| `docs/evidence/` | Experiment write-up and evidence, test results |
| `docs/screenshots/` | Screenshots of both interfaces |

## Using your own parameters

Every default lives in `config/`. Edit those files, or override them without touching the defaults:

1. `--config my_settings.json`: any subset of `config/simulation.json`, plus optional `nodes` and `tenants` lists.
2. Command-line options (table above).
3. Menu option 18 or the app's Settings page to change a setting, then menu option 19 or the app's download button to save everything to a file you can reuse with `--config`.

Later layers win. Menu option 17 and the app's Settings page show every setting and where its value came from. A bad value stops with the file, row or key, and the reason, e.g. `my_tasks.csv, row 4 (line 5), cpu_cores: must be > 0 (got -2)`.

Task files use the columns in [examples/tasks_sample.csv](examples/tasks_sample.csv); leave `id` blank to number tasks automatically. Details in [docs/SPEC.md §3a](docs/SPEC.md).
